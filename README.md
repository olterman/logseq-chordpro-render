# logseq-chordpro-render

This is a small plugin to render logseq blocks with chordpro content as actual guitar chordsheets 
It is a work in progress and my first attempt att creating a logseq plugin ... 

I give thanks to @bergbrains for his [ChordproJSParser](https://github.com/bergbrains/ChordproJSParser)
